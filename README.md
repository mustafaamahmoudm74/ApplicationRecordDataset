# ApplicationRecordDataset
"Welcome to our project repository! This project aims to showcase the implementation of various classification models on a dataset containing demographic and financial information about individuals, including their gender, income, education, family status, and housing type. We have explored popular models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Machines to predict certain outcomes based on the provided features. Our goal is to provide insights into the performance and effectiveness of these models for classification tasks. Feel free to explore the code and data, and we welcome any feedback or contributions!"
